        <p>
          Outer space is the expanse that exists beyond the Earth and between
          celestial bodies. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a hard
          vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma
          of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic
          fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. </p>

        <h1>The Great Lakes</h1>
        <p>
          The Great Lakes, also called the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Great
          Lakes of North America, are a series of interconnected freshwater
          lakes located primarily in the upper mid-east region of North America,
          on the Canada–United States border, which connect to the Atlantic
          Ocean through the Saint Lawrence River. They consist of Lakes Superior
          , Michigan, Huron (or Michigan–Huron), Erie, and Ontario.
